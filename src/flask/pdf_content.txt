### Annexure – I

---

## 1. Preamble
Today's students differ significantly from those of the past. They prefer to make their own decisions and plan their futures. Student aspirations and workplace demands have become highly diverse. Employers expect students to possess multi-disciplinary skills, leadership qualities, and be proficient in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and artificial intelligence.

To continually improve education quality, VIT University introduced the Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS™) in 2008. This initiative allows students to select courses of their choice and adjust their learning pace within the framework of academic requirements. The FFCS also eliminated fixed timetables in favor of slot-based schedules, enabling students to choose their class times freely.

Additionally, students can select courses from various categories, promoting interdisciplinary learning. Slow learners benefit from courses offered in both semesters, allowing them to clear backlogs. Provisions are also in place to reward academically successful students and support research activities in undergraduate programs.

## 2. Scope
FFCS Academic Regulations Version 4.0 govern students admitted from the academic year 2021-22 onwards across all university programs. Course offerings under FFCS are determined by the Academic Council. This version is applicable to both new and existing programs. The regulations encompass previous versions and their subsequent modifications, with this current version reflecting updates approved through the 72nd Academic Council meeting on December 13, 2023.

## 3. Admission
All students seeking admission to B.Tech. and M.Tech. programs must undergo national-level examinations (VITEEE for B.Tech., VITMEE for M.Tech.) conducted by the university once a year. Admissions for other programs are based on merit and specific criteria published annually in the admissions brochure.

## 4. Academic System

### 4.1 Semester
FFCS programs operate on a semester system with two academic semesters per year—Fall (June/July to November) and Winter (December/January to May). Optional weekend intra-semesters and summer sessions may be offered based on demand. The instructional requirements for weekend and summer semesters remain equivalent to regular semesters.
